This directory contain the programming exams and their solutions of the Algorithms and Programming 2 course at Lille University.

The DS1 directory contains exams of the first half of the semestre, the DS2 is for exams of the second half. DS3 contains remedial
examinations.

For the moment, only one subject has been uploaded. It is to be found in the DS2 directory. It is the examn for the 2015-2016 school
year. This one is particularly interesting because I wanted to code the Taquin game module to really test the functions we were 
required to code during the exam, even if the Taquin module was considered given for the purpose of the exam. 

I'll try to upload the solutions to the other exams later, as it could benefit the students, but I need to clean the scripts and add 
some answers before doing it.
